# DubloonDetector
Global Game Jam 2021 game source

The source project excludes the one asset used in making it: Fantasy Skybox FREE. The asset is available at Unity's asset store at https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/fantasy-skybox-free-18353

I called the project MetalDetector when first making it, so in-project that's the common naming.  
Project assets are split into two main folders: \_JimmyHaglund and  \_MetalDetector. The \_JimmyHaglund folder contains generic Unity project scripts and tools. These were not made during the jam. Everything in \_MetalDetector was created during the jam.
